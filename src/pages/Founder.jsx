       Curtis Ray founded MPI速 UNLIMITED LLC with his wife Erin and serves as President and CEO. In 2014, Curtis was introduced to the world of Retirement Planning and Insurance and observed that the traditional investment strategies of the 40l(k), IRA, Real Estate, and Insurance were not providing the retirement people hoped for or expected. To provide solutions to hard-working Americans seeking a great retirement, Curtis invented and developed the MPI速 Premium Strategy, bringing simplicity to financial educat
       ion to Achieve, Protect, Grow, and Accelerate the power of Compound Interest.
